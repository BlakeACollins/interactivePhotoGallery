# interactivePhotoGallery

This is project number 5 for Treehouse's FEWD Techdegree.

In this project, I created an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery.The thumbnails and photos were provided with the project. At the top of the page, I have a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox.
